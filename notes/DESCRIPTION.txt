# StarFight
A planetary conquest strategy game for 2-4 players

HOW TO PLAY:
Run the "launch.py" file to launch the game. Then answer the questions printed to the console. Then the game appears in a pygame window.
If you just want to see a battle straight away: click the "Load game" button, and some ships will appear on the gameboard.

You can select a ship by clicking on it (it turns yellow when selected) and press the up, down, left or right arrows to move the ship
by one step. Every ship can only move once in a turn. If your ship meets an enemy ship, there will be a battle. 

The program also prints to the console, so you will need to have the console open as well. If you click the "New round" button,
the round ends and a summary will be printed to the console. This tells you the game standing: what are the prices of the ships,
which player has how many planets, ships, income, etc.

Music can be turned on/off by hitting the "s" key on your keyboard. You can skip the song and go to the next one by hitting "d",
and hitting "x" means quit the game.


EXPLANATION OF GAME RULES:

GOAL OF THE GAME:
Build a space factory, build ships, use your ships to conquer enemy planets. The more planets you control, the more income
you get per round. Your goal is to conquer all planets.

STARTING A GAME & BASIC CONTROLS:
To start a new game, run the "launch.py" file and answer the questions printed to the console. The 16 planets will be distributed
among the players, the coloured square in the upper left corner shows which player a planet belongs to. First you will need to hit the
"New round" button, because you initially have to wait and gather enough money to build your first space factory. At the end of
every round, a summary is printed to the console, so make sure you see that. You will have to first build a space factory, which
costs just 4000 money, but 10 crystals! So you have to keep clicking the "New round" button until the players have enough crystals.
Once the players have enough crystals for their first space factories, player 1 should click on one of his planets (it will turn yellow
when selected) and then click the "Build space factory" button. A green square on the bottom right corner of the planet signal that
a planet has a space factory, then you will be able to build ships there. It is recommended to select the planet and click
"Build star destroyer" straight away. Then you can select the new ship, and hit the up, down, left or right arrow on your keyboard to
move one step. Every ship can only move once in a turn. After player 1 has finished building his stuff, player 2 should do the same,
and so on. After all players have done their stuff, hit the "New round" button, read the summary, then player 1 should do his stuff, and so on.

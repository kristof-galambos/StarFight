# StarFight
A planetary conquest strategy game for 2-4 players


HOW TO PLAY:

For newcomers, run the "launch_saved_game.py" file to launch the game. The green text messages will tell you what to do! The program also prints to the console, so it's good to have the console open as well, but that's not essential.


GOAL OF THE GAME:

Build a space factory, which allows you to build ships, use your ships to conquer enemy planets. The more planets you control, the more income you get per round. The goal is to conquer all planets.


BASIC CONTROLS:

click on a planet/ship to select/deselect

if you have selected a ship, press the up, down, left or right arrow keys to move

if you have selected a planet, use the buttons on the right to build space factory and ships

green thing in the corner of the planet = space factory. you can only buy ships on planets that have space factory on them

every ship can move only once per round

click NEW ROUND if all players are finished with their moves

if you are already familiar with the controls, you can start your new game by running "launch_new_game.py". Then you will have to wait and keep hitting NEW ROUND until the players have enough crystals to build their first space factories. Then build ships & fight.
